# What am I up to these days?

I'm home, in [Quimper][].

These last few months I've been getting into a lot of new hobbies, and picking
back up some old ones.
Photography, electronics, sewing, drawing, 3D modeling.
I'm not great at any of them but I'm trying.

A non-negligible part of my time has been spent maintaining
[Chitter](https://chitter.xyz/), the Mastodon server that I run with my friends
Violet and Bug.
I've met a lot of wonderful people on there.
The content warning feature, and the liberal way in which the community tends
to use it, are doing wonders for my health.

Speaking of social media and health, I stopped using Twitter altogether.
I don't really miss it.
I do miss people that I only knew there.
