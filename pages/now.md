# What am I up to these days

I'm home, in Quimper

These last few months I've been getting into a lot of new hobbies, and picking back up some old ones. Photography, electronics, sewing, drawing. I'm not great at any of them but I'm trying.

A non-negligible part of my time is spent maintaining [Chitter](https://chitter.xyz/), the Mastodon server that I run with my friends Violet and Bug.

Speaking of social media, I stopped using Twitter altogether. A bit of quiet is nice.
