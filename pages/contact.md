# Talk to me

I have an email address: <codl@codl.fr>. This is probably the best way to get in touch with me.

I'm also on the fediverse at
[codl@chitter.xyz](https://chitter.xyz/users/codl).

Though I don't use it much anymore, you can still reach me on twitter at
[@codl](https://twitter.com/codl).

For sensitive matters, you can send me encrypted email using my
[public PGP key]({{url_for('pgp_key')}}).
You'll have to bear with me though as it will take me some time to remember how to use GPG.
I'm talking, days.
