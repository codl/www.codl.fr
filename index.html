        <h2>Hello</h2>
        <p class="blurb">I'm a software engineering student from Brest, France. Fascinated by audio and video codecs. I always end up working on web things somehow. Harshly critical. Never satisfied. <span class="annotate" title="Sorry, it's an inside joke. It means I support Free Software movements.">I respect freedomes.</span></p>
        <h2>Personal projects</h2>
        <h3>Ongoing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/codl/miso">Miso</a> is an effort to take care of every gripe I've had with music players and music library software. I've had a lot. Currently nowhere near completion.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/codl/dbgb">DBGB</a> is a Game Boy port of <a href="http://youtu.be/nBr7EhL6Jpg">Desert Bus</a>, a minigame from the unreleased Sega CD game <em>Penn &amp; Teller's Smoke and Mirrors</em>. I am hoping to finish it before Desert Bus for Hope 8, so I can put it in a working, official looking Game Boy cart, and send it to them to be auctioned for charity.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Derelict</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://eqbeats.org/">EqBeats</a> is a music publishing platform for ponies I've built with my good friend <a href="http://www.mg0.fr/">fmang</a>. It launched in December of 2011 and has seen steadily growing popularity and traffic since. It's now relatively <span title="ha ha">stable</span>, and neither of us is interested in working on it much anymore.</li>
            <li>Autoplay (or autoplay.py) was my first try at fixing music playing software. It is a rudimentary radio mode for MPD that learns your taste from your playing history.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Others</h3>
        <p>I have some other rubbish uploaded to my <a href="https://github.com/codl">GitHub account</a>, if you're curious. I have also participated in a couple of game jams, my best entry is probably <a href="http://files.codl.fr/1304/swim_post/">swim</a>, a tech-demo-y swimming simulator made in collaboration with my friend Vivix.</p>
