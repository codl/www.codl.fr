        <p>Welcome! I'm <span class="p-nickname">codl</span>, and this is my outlet on the internet.</p>
        <p>Apologies, I'm still sorting everything out, so there isn't much to look at. Do feel free to come back later, though.</p>
        <p>Oh! Perhaps you only came here to <a class="u-email" href="mailto:codl@codl.fr">talk to me</a>, or <a rel="me" href="https://twitter.com/codl">tweet at me</a>? Or could I interest you in some <a rel="me" href="https://github.com/codl">open source projects</a>?</p>
