        <p class="blurb">Hello. I'm a software engineering student from <span class="p-locality">Brest</span>, <span class="p-country-name">France</span>. I am fascinated by audio/video codecs and cryptography, but always end up working on web things somehow. I am harshly critical and never satisfied with my work. I try to remain neutral as much as possible, and not to affiliate myself. <span class="annotate" title="Sorry, it's an inside joke. I mean to say that I support Free Software movements.">I respect free domes.</span></p>

        <h2>Personal projects</h2>

        <h3>Ongoing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/codl/miso">Miso</a> is an effort to take care of every gripe I've had with music players and music library software. I've had a lot. Currently nowhere near completion.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/codl/dbgb">DBGB</a> is a Game Boy port of <a href="http://youtu.be/nBr7EhL6Jpg">Desert Bus</a>, a minigame from the unreleased Sega CD game <em>Penn &amp; Teller's Smoke and Mirrors</em>. I am hoping to finish it before Desert Bus for Hope 8, make a working, official looking Game Boy cart, and send it to be auctioned for charity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Derelict</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://eqbeats.org/">EqBeats</a> is a music publishing platform for ponies I've built with my friend <a href="http://www.mg0.fr/">fmang</a>. It launched in December of 2011 and has seen steadily growing popularity and traffic since. It's now fairly <span title="har har">stable</span>, and neither of us is interested in working on it much anymore.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/codl/autoplay">Autoplay</a> (or autoplay.py) was my first try at fixing music playing software. It is a rudimentary radio mode for MPD that learns your taste from your playing history.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Others</h3>
        <p>I have some other rubbish uploaded to my <a rel="me" href="https://github.com/codl">GitHub account</a>, if you're curious. I have also participated in a couple of game jams, my best entry would be <a href="http://files.codl.fr/1304/swim_post/">swim</a>, a tech demo / “swimming simulator” made in collaboration with my friend Vivix.</p>
