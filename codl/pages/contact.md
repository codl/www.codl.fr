# Talk to me

I have an email address: <codl@codl.fr>. This is probably the best way to get in touch with me.

I'm also on the fediverse at
[codl@chitter.xyz](https://chitter.xyz/users/codl).

For sensitive matters, you can send me encrypted email using my
[public PGP key]({{url_for('pgp_key')}}).
You'll have to bear with me though as it will take me some time to remember how to use GPG.
I'm talking, days.

If you need to reach me quickly in an emergency,
you can message `@codl` on Wire
or [`@codll`](https://t.me/codll) on Telegram.
