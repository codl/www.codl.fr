My financial situation has stabilised and should be stable
for the next year or so, which is a nice change of pace.

I'm working on getting set up as a *micro-entreprise*, a
one-person company, so I can start accepting contract work.

I'm healthier, psychologically and physically. I'm hoping to
continue improving that.
