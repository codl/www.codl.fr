# What am I up to these days?

I'm home, in [Quimper][].

My depression has been getting worse, it eats up most of my time, either in anxiety and anguish, or in self-care.
I wish I could spend that time on art and projects and exciting things, but I must take care of myself first.

I still maintain [Chitter][], my friends's and my Mastodon instance,
albeit I try not to spend as much time on it as before.
I've lost interest in contributing to Mastodon itself.
I'm entertaining the idea of developing my own ActivityPub server instead but I have yet to start working on it.

[I occasionally draw, still][da], usually I join in in drawing
[Donphan.social][donphan]'s pok√©mon of the day every other week.

I've been pondering the possibilty that I may be
<abbr title="Aromantic">aro</abbr> and <abbr title="Asexual">ace</abbr>.
I can't say for sure but it sounds about right.
