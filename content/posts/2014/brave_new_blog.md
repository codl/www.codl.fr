I've had many blogs. This is one of them. All of the previous ones have gone offline eventually. But, unlike the others, this one doesn't have delusions of grandeur.

I needed someplace to put things that don't fit in a single tweet, so I spent a few hours playing with nanoc and now I have a rudimentary blog. You can expect me to post about my personal interests, so: development, open source, audio / video technicalities, web crap, etc. I've reposted my rant about address forms from earlier this year as an example.

Like most things I do, this blog's source and assets are available [on Github](https://github.com/codl/www.codl.fr).
